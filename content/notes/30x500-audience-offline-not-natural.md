When your audience is offline and out in public, they will likely not behave naturally (peer pressure, maintaining a persona, etc). The data we want from our audience should be as close as possible to what they would actually do when they're comfortable and alone; in other words, [the rawer the data the better](notes/30x500-three-questions-to-sell).

Online, though not perfect, is better for these kind of raw data because people are pseudo-anonymous which is enough to let their true selves shine more often than not.
