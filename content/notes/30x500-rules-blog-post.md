Use:
1. Specific language; one measure of this: if someone from your target audience reads it, does he feel like you're writing the post just for him?
2. Hard data and examples; make your points and descriptions (somewhat) irrefutable, or at the very least specific and meaningful
3. Exact quotes
4. Description of how it feels (to feel the [pain](notes/30x500-three-components-pain), to be relieved from it, etc) by channeling the emotions of our observed audience
