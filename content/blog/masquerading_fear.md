Questions can block us from taking action when it comes from uncertainty, anxiety, and fear. These kinds of questions are not the inquiring kind which are normally asked out of curiosity and often times, we are calm when we ask them. Asking anxiety-based question is a stalling technique: most of the time we know the answer, but the answer requires us to take action we are unfamiliar with; so instead of acting, we ask instead under the pretense that we can’t proceed because we “don’t know” the answer yet.

Be wary when these masked questions come about and try to take action before asking them. If after we act and the questions are still unanswered, then feel free to ask them.
